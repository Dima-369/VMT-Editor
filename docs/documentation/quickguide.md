# Quick guide

After you've installed the VMT Editor you're ready to start making your own materials. 

?> You don't need to use any external tools to convert the textures, all can be done in the VMT Editor.

First, make sure the game you're making materials for is selected. Then select the appropriate shader either with the dropdown or by clicking on the buttons next to the dropdown.

To import textures simply drag and drop the source files into appropriate slots or use _Browse_ to look for your textures.

Use the toolbar on the left side or the _Add..._ menu to add different material effects such as detail textures or reflections.

Once you save the material, VMT Editor will copy the converted .vtf files to the material location. If you make changes to your source files you can simply click on the two arrows icon at the end of the text fields to quickly reconvert testures to .vtf.

# Templates

You can create and use templates to speed up your workflow. The parameters in the template will be automatically added to your open material. 

!> This also means that the shader and parameters from the template will overwrite any parameters currently set. 

You can apply them by going into _File > Templates_ and selecting a template.

## Creating templates

Templates are created the same as any other material.

Change the parameters you want to have in the template, then go to _File > Save as Template..._ Template should then appear on the list of templates and ou should be able to use it.

VMT Editor already includes some example templates that you might find useful.

?> Templates are stored in the `templates` folder inside your VMT Editor instalation directory. If you want to edit or delete a template you can do it from there.
